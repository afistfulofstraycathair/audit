# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Node.js and npm installed

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `audit-app` (or your preferred name)
5. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

Open your terminal in the project directory and run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: GMP Audit App with PDF export"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/audit-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Once your code is on GitHub, deploy with:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:

- Build your React app for production
- Create a `gh-pages` branch
- Upload the built files to GitHub Pages

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages (if needed)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select branch: `gh-pages`
6. Select folder: `/ (root)`
7. Click "Save"

### 5. Access Your Live Site

Your site will be available at:

```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/audit-app
```

**Note**: It may take 5-10 minutes for the site to be live after first deployment.

## ðŸ”„ Updating Your Site

To update your deployed site after making changes:

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

# Push to GitHub
